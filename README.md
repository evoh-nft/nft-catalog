Image and metadata reference for all Evoh NFT collections.

## Why IPFS?

**Not all NFTs are created equal!**

The canonical version of each Evoh NFT is made available using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS offers two distinct advantages over other hosting methods:

1. There is no centralized server hosting the image. This means it cannot ever be modified or removed by another person. With IPFS, you truly own the NFT.
2. Authenticity of an NFT may be verified using the IPFS content identifier.

If you wish to learn more, the [IPFS documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/mint-nfts-with-ipfs/#a-short-introduction-to-nfts) provides much more detail on these topics.

## Caring for your NFTs

An NFT that is hosted on IPFS will stay available as long as it stays "pinned". While we make every attempt to keep all Evoh artwork pinned as long as possible, ultimately the final responsibility is upon you as the buyer. Should the image ever stop being available, you can repin it using an IPFS client or a variety of online services.

To repin your image, you must pin 2 images:

1. The actual image.
2. The "metadata" which provides information about the NFT, such as it's properties and the location of the image.

All necessary data is made available within this Github repo. To learn more about pinning, see the [IPFS documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/best-practices-for-nft-data/#persistence-and-availability).
